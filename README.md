## A Deep Learning Model for the Segmentation and Classification of Melanoma Skin Lesions
Melanoma is the most fatal of skin cancers as it accounts for most skin cancer deaths. However,
if melanoma is detected early, it is highly curable. Its diagnosis involves non-invasive exam-
ination of skin lesions and their subjection to biopsy. The non-invasive examination can be
challenging even for dermatologists hence requires a lot of experience. Machine learning mod-
els, trained on dermoscopic and clinical images, have been applied in classification of skin le-
sions to address the shortage of dermatologists and increase chances of early diagnosis. Though
dermoscopy increases accuracy in diagnosis, it is more expensive and needs more technical ex-
pertise while clinical images, which are taken using user-grade cameras, are cheaper and more
accessible hence have a greater potential of making melanoma diagnosis more accessible and
of supporting self-examination to increase chances of early diagnosis. Existing models for
classifying melanoma lesions from clinical images have questionable generalizability having
been trained on small or imbalanced datasets. This research used experimental methodology
to develop a deep learning model for lesion segmentation and classification for increased gen-
eralizability through a comparative study of deep learning architectures and SVMs involving
training and testing across five non-dermoscopic datasets.
